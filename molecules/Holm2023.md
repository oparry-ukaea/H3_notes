- Constant elastic scattering coefficients, $K^{H_2−k}_{el} = 5 \times 10^{−16}$ m$^{3}$ s${−1}$, $k\in{i, H, H_2}$
- Molecular momentum not yet coupled to the ion and atom momentum equations; hence molecular transport is purely diffusive
- Omits the electronic, vibrational, and rotational splitting of the molecules, evaluating transport ground-state molecules only
- To prevent excessive particle, momentum, and energy transport under conditions of low collisionality, the molecular fluxes are limited to the free-streaming fluxes
- The transport coefficients are scaled by the factor $(1+|q/q_{fs}|2)−1/2$, where $q$ is the flux and $q_{fs} = n_k v_{k,th}Q_k$ the corresponding free-streaming flux, $v_{k,th} = \sqrt{T_k e/2m_k}$, and $Q_k$ the limited quantity
- To provide self-consistent plasma solutions, the ion continuity, atom continuity, ion energy, and electron energy equations are balanced by adding the corresponding molecularly-induced sink and source terms to the corresponding equations (?).
