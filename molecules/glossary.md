# Glossary

* Common flux region (CFR):
* Private flux region (PFR):
* Stagnation point
  * Around the midplane in the SOL?
* Divertor baffles aims to
  * enhance the containment of neutral particles within the divertor region (minimizie the number of neutral particles returning to the core)
  * reduce the pressure at the target, improving power exhaust and reducing the target heat load
  * reduces unwanted coupling between the divertor and the core plasma
